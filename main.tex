  \titledquestion{4.8*}[10]
  The {\tt find(x)} method in a SkiplistSet sometimes performs redundant comparisons; these occur when $x$ is compared to the same value more than once. They can occur when, for some node, {\tt u}, {\tt u.next[r] = u.next[râˆ’1]}. Show how these redundant comparisons happen and explain how {\tt find(x)} can be modified so that they are avoided.

\titledquestion{4.9*}[5]
Explain how we can implement a version of a skiplist that implements the SSet interface, but also allows fast access to elements by rank. That is, it also supports the function $get(i)$, which returns the element whose rank is $i$ in $O(\log n)$ expected time. (The rank of an element $x$ in an SSet is the number of elements in the SSet that are less than $x$.)

\titledquestion{4.14* (challenge)}[0]
Using an {\tt SSet} as your underlying structure, design an application that reads a (large) text file and allows you to search, interactively, for any substring contained in the text. As the user types their query, a matching part of the text (if any) should appear as a result.

\noindent\underline{Hint 1}: Every substring is a prefix of some suffix, so it suffices to store all suffixes of the text file.

\noindent\underline{Hint 2}: Any suffix can be represented compactly as a single integer indi- cating where the suffix begins in the text.

Test your application on some large texts, such as some of the books available at \href{http://www.gutenberg.org/}{Project Gutenberg}. If done correctly, your application will be very responsive; there should be no noticeable lag between typing keystrokes and seeing the results.
